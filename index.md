# About me

I am Xiaolan, a PhD candidate at the [University of Canberra](https://www.canberra.edu.au/research/faculty-research-centres/nmrc/Team/our-research-students) with a background of _urban planning_ (7+ years) and _computational social research_. My PhD project investigates **Open Source Smart City Projects and Impacts on Civic Engagement in Australia**. 
My research interests include:
- Citizen(& non-citizen) engagement in urban planning and other local-level policy-making.
- FOSS in the context of smart city and civic engagement, and applications by local communities.


# About my project

## What it is about?
  
This is my PhD research project. It aims to examine the relation between **open source technologies** and **local communities** in the context of **smart cities**, and evaluate to what extent these community-led open source technology-based model of smart cities could enhance **civic engagement** in Australia.

## How it will be conducted?
  
Online research methods (e.g.: web-scraping and data collection with APIs from social media platforms) and enthnography methods (e.g.: observations, interviews and documents collection) will be used to collect data for this research project. The information gained from the research will be used to:  
- Identify successful development patterns for Australian open source smart city projects.  
- Make policy recommendation that could empower local communities.  
- Develop methods that could be easily adopted by local communities to evaluate their open source projects regarding civic engagement.  
 
## How the data will be analysis?

[Social network analysis(SNA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis) & [Thematic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thematic_analysis) will be conducted to map the dynamics between open source technologies, local communities and the urban issues people concerned.

### Thematic analysis

## Where will be the data stored and for how long?
  
It will be stored in UC, in a password-protect computer and backup in UC's cloud space. It will be kept for 5 years after my graduation in UC's cloud.
  
## Who could access to the data?

- Myself, my supervision panel members.  
- Possiblely employee(s) in an AI company providing academic transcription service.

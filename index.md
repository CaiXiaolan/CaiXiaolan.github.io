About me.

I am a Ph.D. student in University of Canberra investigating open source smart city projects and impacts on civic engagement in Australia.

I have 7-year experience of urban planning and 4-year experience of social research mainly on firm engagement in FOSS, and health communication on social media.

My research interests including citizen/non-citizen participation in urban planning and broader local policy-making, smart city, community-led smart city projects, FOSS in smart city- especially applied by citizens/ communities.

I also have an interest of the so-called "Intagramization" of architectures and cities, especially how "Intagramization" impacts on public's perception of locality and places, how it impacts developers' and local governments' branding strategies, and how it impacts on professionals' practices.

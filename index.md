### About me

I am Xiaolan, a PhD student in the University of Canberra investigating **Open Source Smart City Projects and Impacts on Civic Engagement in Australia**. 

I had been working as an urban planner for 7 years. My work included urban renewal planning, social infrastructure plans, urban design and re-zoning. 
Then I studied Master of Social Research in ANU and started to work in the University of Canberra as a computational social researcher after graduation. 
My work mainly focuses on firm's engagement in FOSS and online health communication.

My research interests include:
- Citizen & non-citizen engagement in urban planning and other local-level policy-making.
- FOSS in the context of smart city and civic engagement, and applications by local communities.
- Instagramization of cities and influences on urban planners, architects and policy-makers.

Feel free to contact me to talk about FOSS and things of cities!

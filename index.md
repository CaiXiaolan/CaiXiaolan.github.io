I am Xiaolan, a PhD student at the University of Canberra investigating **Open Source Smart City Projects and Impacts on Civic Engagement in Australia**. 

My research interests include:
- Citizen(& non-citizen) engagement in urban planning and other local-level policy-making.
- FOSS in the context of smart city and civic engagement, and applications by local communities.

Feel free to contact me to talk about FOSS and things of cities!

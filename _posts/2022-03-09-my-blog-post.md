## The journey takes me here

I was firstly trained as a landscape architect and then practiced as an urban planner in China.
When I started my career in 2008, IBM launched its __Smarter Planet__ project. 
2 years later, the local government launched its ambitious and controversial __urban renewal plan__. Local communities started to utilze __social media__ to mobilize their membersm to collaborate with scholars and journalists to rise their voices and to negociated with the local government to change the agenda. 

This made me think about  the role of social media in the dynamic between local government and communities. 
So I came to ANU to study Master of social research to equip myself with methodologies and skills. After that, I work in the Universtiy of Canberra as a computational social researcher on research projects of firm engagement in FOSS and online health communication. 
In 2021, I satarted my PhD in UC to investigate the roles of free/open source technologies, media and the relations with civic engagement in the context of smart city in Australia.

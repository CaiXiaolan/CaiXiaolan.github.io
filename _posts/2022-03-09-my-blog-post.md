I have background both in **Urban Planning** and **Social research**. My research interests including:

- Smart city and technology in urban context.
- FOSS development.

- Application of FOSS by citizens, non-citizens and communities.

Feel free to contact me to talk about FOSS, things about cities and health communication!

## The journey takes me here
I was trained as a landscape architect and practiced as urban planner in China.
When I started my career as an urban planner in 2008, IBM launched its smarter planet project.
2 years later, the local government launched its ambitious urban renewal plan, and the local residents start to use social media to collaborate with scholars and journalists to raise their voices and attempted to change the agenda.
This made me think about the role of social media in the dynamic between local government and residents, but at that time I wa lack of knowledge and skills.

So, I came to Australian National University (ANU) to study Master of social research. After that, I work as a computational social researcher on research projects of open source community and social media in the University of Canberra (UC).
In 2021, I started my PhD in UC to investigate the roles of open source technologies, media and the relations with civic engagement in the context of smart city in Australia.
